## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
This week I used a lot of pair programming. My partner and I switched every hour so. I also used a fiar amount of code cocumentation with regards to telling myself to come back to things or what things still needed to be added. 
2. What went well this week?
Pair programing went well, I learned qiute a bit from my partner and pciked up some new skills/filled in some knowledge gaps. I think additionally having to think about certian problesm from a different perspective helped me to gian a betteru understanding of the code I was writing. Explianing my code out loud helped quite a bit as well. 
3. What would you do differently?
I think the only things I would do differently this week is get more sleep and be better prepared to think through problems from a mental perespective. I could have probaly used some more documentation too as we had some tough janky code that might be difficult to figure out later.

Code documentation can invualuable even to your own code. Solving some issues can be very complex and it never hurts to document how you arrrived at that solution.
