# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


Over all this week went well,although there were a few surprises. I thought I had mastered html and css and it became apparent by the end of the week that I had not. While I dont get stuck anymore in either language, it is taking me longer than I thought to complete things. It was a good wake up call. I think I may be approaching some competency but def have a lot to learn.
