Subject in the Observer pattern has three tasks: Provide methods to register and remove observer.  Maintains a list of its observers/subscribers. And notify them automatically when any state changes.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.
Event listeners, and changes in state like proxystate.on help update the dom when its observed using reusuable code.
