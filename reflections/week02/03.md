## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
console.log, and console.error.  console.log is useful for debugging, and console.error is more from errors being returned from a server api. 
2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
Elements refers to the elements in the Document Object Model (DOM). While youâ€™re in the elements tab you can view all of the HTML and CSS that makes up the page. You can also directly manipulate and edit elements on the page from this tab and immediately see what it will look like. this is extremely useful for debugging. 
3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code? using the biult in debugger, and breakpoints. Knowing and memorizing common console.error messages. etc
