## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
function name(parameters) {
    // statements
}

let name = function(parameters) {
    // statements
}
let name = (parameters) => {
    // statements
}
2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?
Parameters  are used when defining a function, they are the names created in the function definition. 
Arguments, on the other hand, are the values the function receives from each parameter when the function is executed (invoked).
3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
When a function accepts another function as a parameter, or returns a function, it is called a higher-order function.
